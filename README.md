MicrosAil — AI for soil microbial health (diversity & richness).  
Sailing with AI toward healthier soils: predicting soil microbiome indices from soil properties and farming practices, and recommending regenerative actions.

## Current progress
- [x] Repo created and project name set (MicrosAil)
- [x] README.md (this file)
- [x] .gitignore (Python)
- [x] Initial Colab notebook with synthetic dataset, EDA, baseline model (will be saved to `notebooks/microsail_initial.ipynb`)
- [ ] Collect pilot soil samples & sequence (next)
- [ ] Run DADA2/QIIME2 → ASV table
- [ ] Build recommendation engine & dashboard

## How to reproduce (quick)
Open `notebooks/microsail_initial.ipynb` (Colab). Run all cells: notebook generates a synthetic dataset, displays EDA plots, trains a RandomForest baseline and prints R²/MAE.
